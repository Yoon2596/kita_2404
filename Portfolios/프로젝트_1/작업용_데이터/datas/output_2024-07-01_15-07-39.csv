819866,2.8,"It tasted good , I liked the atmosphere of the reserved room and the small forest in the city
And I was also very grateful for your understanding when I had to postpone the reservation time for about 30 minutes before the visit
And there was no valet, so I parked the underground parking lot on my own.. I thought you wouldn't come out because it was a holiday..
But was it just different because it was umakase I don't think it used to be like this‚Ä¶ 
The host wasn't in front of me 
When we arrived at the restaurant, we didn't know where the reserved room was, so we were a little confused whether we should go further inside or stand still
And the main meat was served (sirloin, tenderloin, sirloin, and chuck flap tail). Dinner was 250,000 won per person 
I felt that I wasn't sure if these parts were right for the real price.
To be honest, I think more special parts such as shrimp meat were served when I visited because my acquaintance made a reservation before, so it's a shame
And I thought they would put the grilled meat and shrimp garnish on a warmer, but they just put it in a big bowl and put it on a regular plate, not a warmer 
It was kind of weird for a flying bug to chase the light through the window that you opened for ventilation while grilling meat
And after the main dish, Chogye noodles also tasted good, but if the main meal is not over, isn't it ok to come out a little late 
When the main dishes were not even served, he left the naengmyeon bowl next to him, so I thought he was telling me to eat it all and clean up the bowl on my own
Before that, the main and meal periods were very short, but the meal and dessert periods were much longer, so I was really surprised that they came when I had to call them...
It was more of a course meal than omakase, and they only came in for a while during the main service, so I think this is a service that can be fully experienced in ordinary restaurants And I don't know where to get the feeling of omakase, as someone who thinks that a dish with a sense of craftsmanship and the conviction of the owner or chef there should have been served 
I think it would have been better if the meat cooked by one chef was served to the table in the kitchen rather than the young chef grilling it in front of me.
I think the reason why Omakase is more affordable and satisfying than ordinary restaurants is because it shows and feels the beliefs and research of the chef or owner that makes the food feel special, and also because they show it in front of you and the overall service is very good
I think this place is well-mature The meat itself tasted good
But I really don't know in terms of service.",2022-09-13 12:28:53,,_0_

The employee who responded was busy with no expression, so I felt like I was just taking care of it. I ate in a hurry, so I felt really bad
It's like a 15,000 won meal
But the meat was grilled well, so it was delicious
I think the staff needs to think about it because they brought me food and closed the door or not. It's closed
I didn't have enough time to get ready to greet customers, so I didn't want to waste my food that day",2024-05-12 08:54:54,,Í≥†ÎèÖÌïú ÏãùÎèÑÎùΩÍ∞Ä_11653
